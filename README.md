# Simple Camera Service
This Project is a Simple Camera Service based on the MediaDevices-Api. The Service was extracted from one of my other projects. The other project is named [businesscardwallet](https://gitlab.com/businesscardwallet/bcw.git) and is a PWA for managing bussinesscards. 

For using the Service please have a look at [businesscardwallet](https://gitlab.com/businesscardwallet/bcw.git) or [Impfass-App](https://github.com/hschaeufler/impfpass-frontend)
